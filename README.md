## Goal: Counting Words in Moby Dick

*Captain Ahab was vicious because Moby Dick, the white whale, had bitten off his leg. So the captain set sail for a hunt. For months he was searching the sea for the white whale. The captain finally attacked the whale with a harpoon. Unimpressed, the whale devoured captain, crew and ship. The whale won.*

Herman Melville's book *“Moby Dick”* describes the epic fight between the captain of a whaling ship and a whale. In the book, the whale wins by eating most of the other characters. **But does he also win by being mentioned more often?**

**In this course, you will test a program that analyzes the text of Melville's book.**
