# Recap Puzzle

The rows in the table got messed up!
Match the test strategies with the correct descriptions.

| test strategy | description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Unit Test | files and examples that help with testing |
| Acceptance Test  | collection of tests for a software package |
| Mock | relative amount of code tested |
| Fixture | tests a single module, class or function |
| Regression Test | replaces a complex object to make testing simpler |
| Test suite | prepare tests and clean up afterwards |
| Test data | run tests after changes to see whether everything still works |
| Test coverage | tests functionality from the users point of view |

This exercise works better when each element from the table is printed on a paper card.
