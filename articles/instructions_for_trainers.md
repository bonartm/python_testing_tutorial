# Instructions for Trainers

## Overview
This toolkit helps you to prepare training courses on automated testing in Python. It allows you to create courses with interchangeable

* testing frameworks
* background of participants
* course duration

Our aim is to save you preparation time while leaving room for your own ideas. Most of all, we hope you have fun in your next course.

## How to run a course using this toolkit

1. Introduce the Moby Dick Theme to your trainees
2. Copy the code in *code/mobydick* and *code/test_your_framework*.
3. Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable, so that you can do

    import mobydick

4. Share the chapter "Challenges" with your trainees.
5. Share the chapter "Reference" on your test framework with your trainees.
6. Start coding!


## Why was this example selected?

Three main reasons:

* The implementation is simple enough for beginners.
* Counting words easily yields different results (because of upper/lower case, special characters etc). Therefore the program needs to be thoroughly tested.
* You can easily change the theme to another book from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
